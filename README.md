A study and analysis of traditional Traveling Salesman Problem with Evolutionary ML algorithms

The classical Travelling Salesman Problem involves finding the shortest path between a set of points and locations that must be visited. These points are the cities that a salesperson might visit. This problem is focused on optimization and often used to find most efficient route for data to travel between nodes. TSP is often concerned to find the cheapest solution.

Abstract

Here, in our study, we present the solution of this Travelling Salesman Problem using the Ant Colony Optimization method and then do a comparative study with the Genetic Algorithm.

This document is intended for discussing the Ant Colony approach for the TSP and explaining the whole process.
